# Space Media

## About
This application runs a simple set of videos and reads io from a series of buttons mounted to an exhibit. this allows for different version of the video to be played. This was one of my first forays into Python.

Videos like "How it all began."


## Version Issues
 - Add w.config(cursor="none") after setting up w.
 - Add active=False to ended.
